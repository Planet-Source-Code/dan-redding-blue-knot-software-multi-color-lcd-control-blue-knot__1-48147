I was inspired by the Vacuum Fluorescent Display Simulator project 
by Peter Wilson on Planet Source Code.

I wanted to make a version with more characters and more color options.  The
background color thing was just a happy accident.

The original graphics were all single 12×15 JPGs (and all cyan).  I added a few,
redid a couple and turned them to greyscale so they could be tinted any color.

The program I used to string them together was just a quickie 
w/ hard-coded paths.  I'll clean it up if I ever need to post it 
(thinking about allowing external 'font' files in a future version, 
so I'd turn it into a sort of 'LCD font compiler')

I've included the JPG version of the fonts used in the project + 
the BMP version if you want to tweak the non-lossy image.

This project also includes my cColor class, which I use on a number of 
projects including the ColorLab application on my site.
